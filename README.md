# My Portfolio Website

<p>I wanted to create a portfolio to showcase all my web projects in one place. When designing the website, I took some inspiration from other professional portfolios I've seen online and wanted to try going against the default flow of websites while keeping it minimalist.</p>
<p>I feel the portfolio itself is a great show of my skills and ability to create an aesthetic, responsive, and complex yet simple looking website.</p>
