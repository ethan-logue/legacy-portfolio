        <h2>Origins</h2>

        <p>Bassist Nestor Chumak, guitarist Steve Sladkowski, and drummer Zack Mykula are childhood friends who attended school in Toronto together. Two of them met in third grade, and the third met them in high school at Humberside Collegiate Institute.Throughout their childhood, they played in a number of bands together. Vocalist and guitarist Stefan Babcock also grew up playing in bands in Toronto. During high school, Babcock was the lead guitarist for a ska band called Stop Drop N Skank that he formed with some of his classmates at Earl Haig Secondary School. Babcock encountered Chumak, Sladkowski, and Mykula on occasion at local Toronto music venues, but was not close with them at the time.</p>
        
        <p>After high school, Babcock's band Stop Drop N Skank dissolved. While attending Ryerson University, he worked with Nestor Chumak to record a song he had written for a school project. Following its completion, the duo teamed up with Chumak's friends Sladkowski and Mykula to form a group called <strong>Topanga</strong>. The name comes from Topanga Matthews, a character on the 1990s Disney sitcom Boy Meets World whom the band has called "our first middle-school crush." They decided to record a four-track EP together, although Babcock says that at the time, they considered this a one-off project and didn't think of themselves as a "real band." Topanga EP (later retitled Lionheart EP) was released as a free download on December 7, 2010.</p>
        
        <p>Shortly after the release of their debut EP, the band began performing live together. They played their first show ever at the Bovine Sex Club in January 2011. According to Babcock, the EP was gaining traction online, and they began receiving increasingly better show offers. By the beginning of 2012, they had begun touring with Hollerado and were signed to Hollerado's label, Royal Mountain Records. On February 15, 2012, they released the two-track Oceans 7" with Royal Mountain</p>
        

        <h2>A New Name</h2>
        <p>In 2012, Topanga began contemplating making their first full-length album, and wanted to find a producer who could help them capture their heavy performance style in a studio recording. Inspired by The Bronx's 2008 self-titled album, they were interested in working with its producer, Dave Schiffman, an industry veteran who had worked with artists such as Rage Against the Machine, Weezer, and Anti-Flag. They sent him a demo and, to their surprise, he liked it and soon flew to Toronto to begin working on their album. The album was recorded in Montréal, in a studio that belongs to professional former F1 driver Jacques Villeneuve.</p>

        <p>While working on the album, the band decided to change their name from Topanga to something else. According to Babcock, they felt the name was less fitting now that they had locked down a heavy punk rock style (as opposed to the lighter rock style they had played early on). In addition, Disney had announced a new spinoff series based on Boy Meets World, and the band didn't want to be associated with it. After a few months of uncertainty, they decided on the name <strong>PUP</strong>. The name is an acronym of a quote by Babcock's grandmother, who said that playing in a rock band was a "pathetic use of potential." The band officially announced their new name via social media on April 16, 2013.</p>

        <p>PUP made a list of dream producers they would like to work with. On the top of the list was Dave Schiffman. PUP sent demos to producer Dave Schiffman, he was the first person to receive them. Within three days, he messaged back and said he was in. A week later he arrived in Toronto. It was his enthusiasm for the band that caused the members to quit their day jobs and take PUP to the next level. The upcoming album's release date was set for October 8, 2013. From September to the end of November 2013, PUP joined Hollerado and the Zolas on a 24-stop tour across Canada to promote the album. Upon its release, the self-titled debut album, PUP, was met with critical praise. The Calgary Herald named PUP one of Canada's best new bands, and Stereogum listed them as one of the top 40 new bands of 2013. PUP won two Bucky Awards from CBC Radio 3 for Best Live Show and Best New Artist in 2013, and was nominated for Best Video.</p>


        <h2>Acclaim and Awards</h2>
        <p>PUP has enjoyed critical success, having been nominated or won in major Canadian contests such as the Juno Awards, the Polaris Music Prize, the CBC Bucky Awards, among others. Their first single "Reservoir" was nominated for a SOCAN Song-writing Prize. It was also used on gameplay footage showed at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2016 for the game <em>Watch Dogs 2</em>.</p>

        <p>PUP won two Bucky Awards from CBC Radio 3 for Best Live Show and Best New Artist in 2013, as well as a nomination for Best Video. PUP's first album was long-listed for the prestigious Polaris Music Prize of 2014. The national newspaper The Globe & Mail called them out as front-runners in the contest along with Arcade Fire, Mac DeMarco, BadBadNotGood, among other artists. PUP has been nominated for three Juno Awards. In 2015, PUP was nominated for Recording Package of the Year and Video of the Year for "Guilt Trip." In 2016, PUP was nominated again for Video of the Year for "Dark Days.</p>

        <p>PUP achieved commercial success with the release of their second album, The Dream Is Over, on May 27, 2016, with chart achievement recognition from Billboard in several categories including Canadian Albums, Alternative Albums, Heatseekers, Independent Albums, Top Rock Albums, and Top Album Sales. In July 2016, The Dream is Over was nominated to the short-list of the Polaris Music Price 2016. Rolling Stone also listed the "Sleep in the Heat" music video as #4 of the "10 Best Music Videos of 2016.</p>
