            <h2>Introduction</h2>

            <p>Media is woven into our daily lives and subconsciously affects how we view men and women. All forms of media communicate images of the different genders, many of which insinuate unrealistic, stereotypical, and limiting perceptions. These underlying themes in the media we consume normalize traditional roles in relationships and inequality for women in most aspects of life.</p>

            <h2>Underrepresentation and Misrepresentation</h2>

            <p>	As we all know, media distorts reality, but how far does it go? We may think reality tv shows like The Kardashians and any of the shows on TLC and HGTV are as distorted as shows about real people can get, but there are many underlying layers in almost all shows and movies that distort reality in our subconscious.  One of which is the underrepresentation of women. In prime-time television, there are three times as many white men as women or children’s shows where it’s a two-to-one ratio of men to women. This causes many to believe that there are indeed more men than women and that men are the cultural standard.</p>

            <p>	Media continues to show men and women in stereotypical ways that limit our perception of human possibilities. “Typically, men are shown as active, adventurous, powerful, sexually aggressive, and largely uninvolved in human relationships. Just as consistently, women are portrayed as sex objects who are usually young, thin, beautiful, passive, dependent, and often incompetent and dumb.” Since we consume media that portrays such stereotypes daily, our whole culture goes along with these limiting artificial ‘rules’ of society. In visual culture, female characters are usually devoting their energy to improving their appearances, taking care of homes and people, and thinking about the other male characters.</p>

            <h2>Advertising</h2>

            <figure id="fig1">
                <img src="images/baby_soft.jpg" alt="Love’s Baby Soft Advertisement">
                <figcaption>Figure 1 - Love’s Baby Soft Advertisement</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>	Advertisements in all forms have long sexualized the female figure and depicted them in ways that were attractive to their male audience to make them more inclined to purchase their product. This tactic reinforces the stereotypes from the other forms of media and plants the idea that women are here for the pleasure of men. In 1968, Philip Morris released a new cigarette brand that was aimed towards women with its narrow and long design, much different than Philip Morris’ previous brands called “Virginia Slims.” Announced in the ads were “tailored for your hands – for your lips” and how they were “slimmer than the fat cigarettes that men smoke.” These cigarettes were aimed at the newly liberated women whose lives had been transformed by progress in politics and medicine and who found themselves thinking about careers and able to conder divorce without the scandalization from the past. For the first time, women were able to think about their lives playing out with somewhat equal footing as men. And the ads for Virginia Slims celebrated this equality by contradicting it by telling the women: “You’ve come a long way, baby.” This just shows how advertising has a way of cutting through the noise and reflecting what people really want, or at least what the mostly white and mostly male advertisers assumed women wanted. Which was and still is the idea that women just want to be attractive to men.</p>

            <p>This advertisement for a body spray released in 1974 is a prime example of the idea that advertisers think women just want to be sexy and attractive to men. With the slogan “Because innocence is sexier than you think”, it’s unclear whether the innocence in question is being marketed toward grown women or young girls. There was a video advertisement that accompanied this product as well with the woman on the right who wore makeup that made her look younger and more “innocent” and had a man talking over her while she licked a lollipop and stared at the camera. In the man’s voiceover, he promises that Love’s Baby Soft offers the scent of “a cuddly clean baby ... that grew up very sexy.” This worrying image seems to sexualize young females by promising older women that if they use this scent, they will be more attractive to men.</p>

            <h2>Effects on Reality</h2>

            <p>Modern society is heavily influenced by the media, be it television, newspapers, movies, the internet, or social media. Media is responsible for the dissemination of information and shapes our attitudes and belief systems. It has a huge influence on gender stereotyping which depicts ideas that may not be appropriate or safe and normalize them for each gender which, in turn, creates standards for individuals to follow shaping how gender is treated in the workplace, justice, and mentally. With young girls being surrounded by visual culture in this digital age, many of their feelings can stem from how their gender is portrayed without even realizing it. How female bodies are portrayed culturally as objects to be looked at by men influences women and how they view themselves in society and in front of a mirror. Females hardly get to be themselves in such a culture because they are who they appear to be to men and the women whom they are supposed to compete with for the man’s attention. Growing up in this culture has these young women constantly analyzing and critiquing their appearances with those they see on television and in magazines and not for themselves, but for the eyes of others. In most cases these women whom these young women are idealizing with the “perfect female figure” have had their breasts lifted, faces contoured, bodies waxed, and their hair extended. They portray the “ideal” body by western beauty standards which is extremely unrealistic and often unobtainable.</p>

            </figure>

            <p>Even as children, media is conforming these young minds to the set belief system. A study was done on preschool girls and how the norms of Disney princesses effects them showed that the girls’ attitudes were influenced towards beauty, materialism via clothes and accessories, body language, and the thought that boys can’t be princesses. Similarly, many superhero programs are targeted at young boys and have a subtext of masculinity and contributing to male-stereotyped play for boys and increased fake weapon play.</p>

            <p>Other forms of media portray women negatively to impressionable minds and mature minds alike. The music is very influential in a majority of the population and while Hip-Hop and rap are the most popular, they don’t display the best messages. They portray women in hyper-sexualized clothes and are shown doing provocative dances. Their lyrics can be aggressive, sexual, and disrespectful towards women which inadvertently support sexism and normalize such behaviors.</p>

            <p>With such societal norms, women can feel pressured into being the stereotypical housewife that takes care of the kids while the father goes to work, but the media needs to show children that women can be so much more.</p>

            <h2>Achieving Gender Equality</h2>

            <p>Media largely impacts our perceptions and ideas about the roles of women in society and unfortunately, tends to perpetuate gender inequality. However, if we can break the cycle, the media has the power to achieve gender equality. We can do this by creating gender-sensitive and gender-transformative content and breaking gender stereotypes.  Media, and the people who use it, must start to challenge societal norms and attitudes regarding perceptions. We can challenge it by getting more women into leadership positions in all aspects of culture and proving they can do things just as good or even better than the men who have kept these positions for decades or even centuries. Once women are being portrayed correctly within visual culture at a rate equal to men, then women can have equal footing with men and this change could be reflected globally.</p>
