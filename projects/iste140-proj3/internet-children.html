            <h2>Introduction</h2>

            <p>In the new modern age a new question has been asked by parents all around the world, "How long should I allow my child to be online?". Now we may not have the answer to that question just yet, we do already know how much time the average child spends online and how it effects them. After many different studies, this is the average amount if time we have found that a child will spend online.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Kids 8 - 12 on average are on the internet for 5 and a half hours a day, while teens 13 - 18 are on the internet on average 8 and a half hours a day.</li>
                <li>79% of teens say that at least once a week they go on a social media platform or watch online videos.</li>
                <li>32% of teens said they wouldn’t want to live in a world without youtube, it's become a necessity for them.</li>
                <li>64% of tweens say that they watch online videos and 43% say they play games on their phone a day.</li>
                <li>To my surprise the average screen time increased substantially in kids who are in a lower-income family, as they spend around 6 to 7 and a half hours on screen time a day.</li>
                <li>71% of parents with a child under 12 are afraid of the amount of time their child is on their screens</li>

            <h2>How Screentime Affects Children</h2>
            
            <h3>Pros</h3>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Kids will be shown new things and knowledge at a much faster rate</li>
                <li>It helps children with their school work/hobbies</li>
                <li>They will be able to meet many more people than ever before</li>
                <li>It allows people to keep in touch and communicate much easier than before/grow them socially.</li>
                <li>Allows the children to have more role models.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Cons</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>It will most likely keep your child up much later in the night from actively being on the internet, or from being exposed to blue light before trying to sleep.</li>
                <li>Your child spending too much time on screens can lead to an unhealthy life, in particular obesity. 1.5 hours of watching t.v. a day can lead to obesity in children ages 4-9, while teens that watch 5 hours daily are 5 times more likely to become obiese than teens with 0-2 hours a day.</li>
                <li>Advertising could be a bad influence, like seeing ads for junk food, smoking or drinking.</li>
                <li>Very young children that spend too much time on screens show delayed learning in attention, thinking, language, and social skills. The reason behind this is thought to be because of the child's lack of interaction with people.</li>
                <li>It has been seen that while children try to multitask by being on the internet and trying to work at the same time, it affects how they do in school in a negative way.</li>
                <li>The child's behavior may be affected in a more negative/ violent way because your child may try to mimic what he saw people online/tv do.</li>
                <li>If spent on too much time the child could become addicted to the internet may it be through watching videos, or playing games. This could even lead to the child losing interest in real world activities and real social connections and gatherings.</li>
                <li>Not exclusive to children, but being on the internet gives a sense of animosity that makes the user have a sense of invincibility and will make the user feel more comfortable doing and saying things that they would not usually say or do, especially if they were actually in front of the person.</li>
                <li>Television viewing negatively affects locomotive skills, physical strength, dietary habits and adiposity.</li>
                <li>Television viewing negatively affects the cognitive and socio-emotional development of children, and excessive screen time is associated with poorer mental health during adolescence.</li>
                <li>Physical activity does not compensate for the adverse effects of screen time.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Effects on the Mind</h2>

            <h3>Cognitively</h3>

            <h4>Benefits</h4>

            <p>Some studies have suggested that cognitive development in relation to media use is highly content dependent. For example, playing video games has been shown to improve visual attention skills, but this effect was positive only for those games that were action-based, and playing prosocial video games, in which game characters help and support each other, led to increases in prosocial behavior.</p>

            <p> Moreover, some TV shows can help children learn numbers and letters. Several studies demonstrated that the viewing of specific TV programmes can have positive effects on language development in children aged 3–5 years. In one study, the viewing of ‘Dora the Explorer’ resulted in 13.30 more vocabulary words acquired at the age of 30 months compared with non-viewers, in comparison with the viewing of ‘Teletubbies’, which was negatively related to vocabulary acquisition. A similar study found the viewing of ‘Sesame Street’ to be educational for children at a certain age, yet it was associated with delayed language acquisition for younger children.</p>

            <p>The potential cognitive benefits are believed to originate from high-quality media contents that use strategies known to support language development, including the labeling of objects, characters speaking directly to the child and allowing opportunities for the child to respond.</p>

            <p>What's more, co-viewing with an adult has been shown to increase the cognitive development benefits of suitable media content. For example, when pre-schoolers viewed ‘Barney & Friends’ with an adult, they acquired 3.5 words, compared with an average of just one word when the programme was viewed alone. Co-viewing increases parent–child interactions and offers opportunities for the adult to enhance the media content.</p>

            <h4>Risks</h4>

            <figure id="fig2">
                <img src="images/baby-screen.jfif" alt="Baby using tablet">
                <figcaption>Figure 1 - Photo of a baby using a tablet</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>Although few data are available on the relationship between cognitive development and computer use/video gaming, these concepts are supported by psychological studies evaluating the effect of TV viewing. Research in Korean children from 24 to 30 months of age demonstrated that the risk of language delay increased proportionately with time spent in front of the TV. Toddlers with 2–3 h of daily TV viewing had a 2.7-fold higher risk of language delay than those with less than 1 h, while toddlers with over 3 h per day had about a three-fold increase in the relative risk of language delay. Similarly, a longitudinal study reported that children with higher TV viewing at 29 months of age exhibited less school readiness at 65 months of age. This manifested as decreased vocabulary and number knowledge scores as well as lower classroom engagement.</p>

            <p>The anatomical features that underlie changes in cognitive development related to TV viewing have been scarcely investigated. This was addressed by a recent study that examined the association between duration of TV viewing and regional grey/white matter volume in Japanese children. In both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses, TV viewing was positively correlated with changes in the frontopolar and medial prefrontal regions, the former of which contributes to intellectual functioning. Furthermore, a negative correlation between TV viewing and intelligent quotient was confirmed.</p>

            <h3>Psychologically</h3>

            <h4>Positives</h4>

            <figure id="fig3">
                <img src="images/connecting-screen.jpg" alt="Child connecting over Zoom">
                <figcaption>Figure 2 - Photo of a child connecting to class over Zoom</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>Quality content can enhance social and language skills for all children aged 2 years and older, particularly for children living in poverty or who are otherwise disadvantaged. Educational TV reaches children in lower-income homes almost as much as higher-income homes, and among children whose families own a laptop or mobile device, barriers to accessing and using educational content have almost disappeared. Well-designed, age-appropriate educational programs and screen activities can be powerfully pro-social, helping children to learn anti violence attitudes, empathy, tolerance and respect. Appropriately used, screen time can calm a child who is overexcited or distressed (e.g., during a medical procedure). But screen learning can affect behavior both positively and negatively, so ensuring quality content is crucial.</p>

            <p>Developing a family ‘media action plan’ can help protect and reinforce quality family time. Ideally, planning begins prenatally; accounts for the health, education and entertainment needs of each child and family member; includes screen-based activities in child care; and is reviewed periodically. Setting meaningful limits when children are young and sharing them as a family is far easier than cutting back screen time when children are older. Studies have found that parents’ comfort level with saying ‘no’ to their children’s requests to play games on screen, along with their own media-related beliefs, intentions and attitudes, are key components of constructive, positive limit-setting. For children—and parents—off-screen time is critical for developing essential life skills such as self-regulation, creativity and learning through physical and imaginative play.</p>

            <h4>Negatives</h4>

            <figure id="fig4">
                <img src="images/tablet-kids.jfif" alt="Children covering faces with tablet">
                <figcaption>Figure 3 - Photo of a children covering their faces with tablets</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>Sixty studies were included in the review. Higher levels of screen time were associated with more severe depressive symptoms. We found moderate evidence for an association between screen time and poor psychological well-being and body dissatisfaction especially among females. Relationships between screen time and anxiety were inconsistent and somewhat gender specific. Social media use was consistently associated with poorer mental health.</p>

            <h2>Impacts on Their Health</h2>

            <figure id="fig5">

                <figcaption>Figure 4 - Graphic depicting children watching tv</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>Now that we have gone over the pros and cons of screen times effect on a child's mind, now we must see how it effects their physical health.</p>
                <p>Research indicates that higher levels of physical activity do not compensate for the negative effects of screen time. This is exemplified by the National Health and Nutritional Examination Surveys (NHANES) study conducted in over 1000 children from USA aged 6–15 years. The NHANES study evaluated the relationship between physical strength – assessed by grip, leg extension, modified pull-ups and plank – and screen time. After controlling for gender, body mass index and days per week with at least 1 h of physical activity, TV viewing, but not computer use and video gaming, was inversely associated with physical strength. This study demonstrated that higher TV viewing was associated with lower physical strength, irrespective of physical activity. It also highlighted the idea that not all types of screen use are equal with respect to health effects.</p>
                <p>The negative impact of TV viewing on physical development has been shown in children under 6 years of age. A prospective, longitudinal study that evaluated the relationship between TV watching at 29 months old and physical strength at 65 months of age in 1997 Canadian children reported that gross motor skills were reduced by high screen time.</p>
                <p>During early adolescence, time spent on screen-based activities contributes to the chance of reporting general physical complaints, in particular, headache and backache. Differences in symptoms according to screen type have been documented. For example, headaches were more frequent during TV viewing for more than 3 h, whereas backache and headache were more likely during computer use or video gaming for more than 3 h. Furthermore, headache and backache associated with screen time do not appear to be ameliorated by physical activity. The threshold for a suitable level of screen usage is difficult to set because the effects of different types of screen time on physical problems are accumulative.</p>

            <h2>How to Help Reduce Screen Time</h2>

            <p>With all that being said, a good balance of screentime is the best way to approach your child's screentime. So in case you need help reducing your child's screentime, here's some tips on how to accomplish that.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Turn off the background tv noise - even if you have the tv on for background noise, it is more likely to drown in the kids attention, and will begin to unconsciously watch the tv instead.</li>
                    <li>Try not to be in front of a screen while eating.  - If you instead eat at a dinner table you are much more likely to snap back to reality and socialize. It raises your awareness of how full you really are and stops mindlessly eating.</li>
                    <li>Take the screens out of the bedroom - as said before you don’t even have to be actively watching, but if you have been exposed to blue light before trying to go to bed, it will keep you up much longer.</li>
                    <li>You could make certain days of the week “No screen days” and instead play with your children outside, cook, or read.</li>
                    <li>During the time they are on screens, you could make them do a light physical activity like yoga or lift weights during commercial breaks.</li>
                    <li>When your children’s friends gather at your house, limit the amount of time they play video games. After 20-30 minutes of playing, suggest that the children move on to something else that does not involve a screen, like playing a board game or physical game (including playing outside).</li>
                    <li>Avoid using electronic devices as a reward or punishment. This makes screens seem even more important.</li>
                </ul>
