            <h2>Introduction</h2>

            <p>Social media use (interacting with others through online electronic forums such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Youtube, etc.) has become an enormously popular tool for social interaction. Social media use is an important interactive tool for youth and young adults and, unlike more traditional media, users play an active role in creating and shaping the experience. Moreover, social media use is an important element of the developmental process for youth and young adults as they interact with others and present their forming identities online. Because of this growing presence of social media in young people’s lives, some commenters have expressed concern about potential adverse effects. Could reliance on social media for social interactions pejoratively influence real-life social contacts, leading to isolation and loneliness? Could social media use isolate people from close contact and communication with others, thereby decreasing empathy? And could overuse of social media lead to larger problems with mental health including suicidal ideation? The current study aims to address some of these questions in a relatively large sample of young adults.</p>

            <h2>Discussion on Mental Health Impact</h2>

            <p>This study has attempted to systematically analyze the existing literature on the effect of social media use on mental health. Although the results of the study were not completely consistent, this review found a general association between social media use and mental health issues. Although there is positive evidence for a link between social media and mental health, the opposite has been reported.</p>

            <p>For example, a previous study found no relationship between the amount of time spent on social media and depression or between social media-related activities, such as the number of online friends and the number of “selfies”, and depression. Similarly, Neira and Barber found that while higher investment in social media (e.g. active social media use) predicted adolescents’ depressive symptoms, no relationship was found between the frequency of social media use and depressed mood.</p>

            <p>In the 16 studies, anxiety and depression were the most commonly measured outcome. The prominent risk factors for anxiety and depression emerging from this study comprised time spent, activity, and addiction to social media. In today's world, anxiety is one of the basic mental health problems. People liked and commented on their uploaded photos and videos. In today's age, everyone is immune to the social media context. Some teens experience anxiety from social media related to fear of loss, which causes teens to try to respond and check all their friends' messages and messages on a regular basis.</p>

            <p>On the contrary, depression is one of the unintended significances of unnecessary use of social media. In detail, depression is limited not only to Facebooks but also to other social networking sites, which causes psychological problems. A new study found that individuals who are involved in social media, games, texts, mobile phones, etc. are more likely to experience depression.</p>

            <p>The previous study found a 70% increase in self-reported depressive symptoms among the group using social media. The other social media influence that causes depression is sexual fun. The intimacy fun happens when social media promotes putting on a facade that highlights the fun and excitement but does not tell us much about where we are struggling in our daily lives at a deeper level. Another study revealed that depression and time spent on Facebook by adolescents are positively correlated. More importantly, symptoms of major depression have been found among the individuals who spent most of their time in online activities and performing image management on social networking sites.</p>

            <p>Another study assessed gender differences in associations between social media use and mental health. Females were found to be more addicted to social media as compared with males. Passive activity in social media use such as reading posts is more strongly associated with depression than doing active use like making posts. Other important findings of this review suggest that other factors such as interpersonal trust and family functioning may have a greater influence on the symptoms of depression than the frequency of social media use.</p>

            <h2>Affects of Social Media</h2>

            <h3>Anxiety</h3>

            <figure id="fig1">
                <img src="images/head.jpg" alt="Overwhelmed by social media">
                <figcaption>Figure 1 - Graphic depicting being overwhelmed by social media</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>Link between social media and compulsive behavior has been reported by various studies. It has been found that forty five percent of British adults feel restlessness when they are not able to access their social networking sites. In Rosen, it is reported virtual generation oftenly check the message on their social networking application. It is also found that younger generation feels restlessness when they were not able to access messages of their social networking applications apart from their counterparts, giving rise to Phantom vibration syndrome. Which is a nothing but the perception of an addict person regarding the vibration of his cell phone any victim of PVS reflects obsession of frequent checking of social messages exhibits manifestation of anxiety caused by cell phones.</p>

            <h3>Stress</h3>

            <p>In present era addiction of social media is incredibly increased, once an individual gets on, it is difficult to refrain from its use. Comments and likes acts as positive reinforcement and making it more difficult to stop it. Certain people compare their lives with the immaculate lives of their friends. Dick reported with the use of free social networking services (Facebook & Twitter) people remain connected with friends and read productive content but at the same time lose a lot of discretion and privacy. In present world Anxiety is one of the fundamental mental health problems. People fret about the likes and comments of their uploaded pictures and videos. In the present era hardy any person is immune in context of social media. The Hearty Soul (2016) asserts that longer time you spend on social media more you are depressed, further it also reported that usage of social networking applications like Facebook and Twitter are less helpful to students in remaining more focused and less stressed. Kaur & Bashir explored both positive and negative effects of social media on mental health of adolescents, positive effects include socialization, enhanced communication, learning opportunities and access to health information.</p>

            <h3>Depression</h3>

            <figure id="fig2">
                <img src="images/depression.jpeg" alt="Picture portraying depression">
                <figcaption>Figure 2 - Picture portraying depression</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>From the above literature it is clear social media is the basic agent that not enhances but also nourishes the mental health problems. Excessive use of Social media leads an individual to disastrous results that starts with anxiety and leads to the depression. In it is revealed that depression and time spent on Facebook by adolescents is positively correlated. Rosen, mirrored these findings and revealed that symptoms of major depression has been found among the individuals who spent most of their time in online activities and performing image management on social networking sites. Similarly asserted that students who use Facebook intensely reports enhanced loneliness. It is also found that social media usage also enhances the psycho-social problems like adjustment& self-esteem.Research conducted by Davila (2012) reflected severe depression symptoms among younger generation are associated with less positive and more negative social interactions. In contrary evidence of inverse relation between depression and internet usage has been reported by they further suggest that various social forms like gaming & chatting diminish the depression risk.</p>

            <h3>Loneliness</h3>

            <p>Social media usage is growing at a remarkable rate predominantly among young adults, surprisingly in spite of having greater interconnectivity, present young generation is lonelier than other groups and even loneliest ever. Loneliness is one of the prime concerns of present virtual society, as it is intimately related to serious health problems. Loneliness can be understood as discrepancy among desired level and practical level of social contacts of an individual’s social life. According to Kim, uncontrolled, unhygienic and compulsive usage of internet resources enhances loneliness over the time also higher level of internet usage among young generation enhances the emotional loneliness.While Mental Health foundation of United Kingdom asserts 60% of the young adults of age group 18-34 admitted loneliness despite of having all social media applications and facilities to run these applications. Likewise researchers Skues, Williams, & Wise, revealed more the Facebook friends a student have higher the level of loneliness he/she reports. In contrary to this, researchers Deters, & Mehl, revealed people who consumes less social networking revealed higher score of shyness and loneliness, they are also socially less active, similarly problem of loneliness also gets reduced due to increase status updating Sheldon. </p>

            <h2>Real Life Expressions on the of Affects Social Media</h2>

            <p>Participants expressed the view that they felt social media was a risk to mental wellbeing. They identified stress, low self-esteem, depression and suicidal ideation as likely negative consequences of social media. This was despite reporting that it can help to connect people and be a source of support. Notably, many of these comments were made in a general third-party attributions sense, rather than being derived from personal experiences.</p>

            <h2>Minimizing the Negative Impact</h2>

            <p>The truth is, social media and mental health can affect us all in a negative way if we let it. It’s something everyone needs to be aware of. Then, if it becomes a problem, it can be addressed right away. There are a number of proactive measures you can take to ensure the time you spend on social media is as healthy as possible. </p>

            <p>If you’re wondering how to improve your mental health, consider these tips as they relate to social media and technology.</p>

            <h3>Limit social media use</h3>

            <p>Download an app or use the tracking feature on your phone to monitor how long you spend on social platforms each day. Most people are surprised at how much time they’re actually scrolling. </p>

            <p>Use the information to set a realistic goal about how much thought, energy, and time you’re willing to give to social media each day. You don’t have to quit altogether but setting limits can be a good way to minimize negative impacts on your life.</p>

            <p>Spending less time on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, and other platforms can be a good thing. Replace some of that social time with healthy activities like working out, gardening, meditating, volunteering in your community, learning a new language, or spending time in nature.</p>
                
            <h3>Power off devices</h3>

            <p>Turn your cell phone or other devices off during specific periods each day, like when you’re driving, working out, in a business meeting, eating dinner, playing with your children, at school, or spending time with friends socializing. Turn off devices and leave them outside your bedroom to charge overnight.</p>

            <h3>Turn off notifications</h3>

            <p>You’ll be far less distracted during the day if you turn social notifications off. It’s difficult to resist checking every time you hear beeping, dinging, buzzing, and ringing alerting you to the latest posts, replies, and activity (see: FOMO).</p>

            <p>Instead, set limits about how often and when you’ll check your social feeds. Start out small, like limiting checking to every 15 minutes. Then, gradually increase the time between checking to 30 minutes, 45 minutes, and so on.</p>
